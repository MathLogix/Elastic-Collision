# Elastic-Collision
An elastic collision is a type of collision in which both momentum and kinetic energy are conserved. This means that:
- Momentum Conservation: The total momentum of the system before the collision is equal to the total momentum after the collision.
- Kinetic Energy Conservation: The total kinetic energy of the system before the collision is equal to the total kinetic energy after the collision.

Key Characteristics:
1. No Energy Loss: Unlike inelastic collisions, no kinetic energy is transformed into other forms of energy (like heat or sound).
2. Ideal Conditions: Elastic collisions are often idealized scenarios, typically observed in atomic or subatomic particles, as well as in perfectly hard spheres.
3. Mathematical Representation:
   m1u1 + m2u2 = m1v1 + m2v2 (momentum)
   0.5 * m1u1^2 + 0.5 * m2u2^2 = 0.5 * m1v1^2 + 0.5 * m2v2^2 (kinetic energy)

Applications:
Physics Experiments: Used in experiments to study particle interactions.
Sports: Collisions in sports balls (like billiards) can be approximated as elastic.
Summary
Elastic collisions are fundamental concepts in physics, illustrating the conservation laws that govern motion and energy in isolated systems.
